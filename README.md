# Surjith Jayakumar â€” Portfolio v2

Upgraded dark-neon portfolio with animations, particles, typing effect, timeline, skills, and ready-to-deploy setup.

## Quick start
1. Install Node.js (v18+ recommended)
2. In project folder:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the local URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Notes
- Contact form is frontend-ready. Add a backend endpoint `/api/contact` to send emails (Nodemailer or serverless functions).
- Drop your real `resume.pdf` in the project root to enable resume download.
- Customize `src/components/*` to change text, projects, or skills.
